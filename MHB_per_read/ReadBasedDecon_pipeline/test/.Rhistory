# R package "entropy" is required for calculating methylation entropy. This package implements various estimators of entropy, such as the shrinkage estimator by Hausser and Strimmer, the maximum likelihood and the Millow-Madow estimator, various Bayesian estimators, and the Chao-Shen estimator. It also offers an R interface to the NSB estimator. Furthermore, it provides functions for estimating Kullback-Leibler divergence, chi-squared, mutual information, and chi-squared statistic of independence. In addition there are functions for discretizing continuous random variables. More information at: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=entropy.
