We can run preprocess_the_data_with_largerSM_likefile before from_a_folder_of_sm to make deconvolution faster. But this is not mandatory, only to run the deconvolution faster.



To run preprocess_the_data_with_largerSM_likefile just use something like q25d1.txt_inverted (or q25d1.txt. Anyone is enough. Not necessary to use both q25d1.txt_inverted and q25d1.txt) on the all_bg_rolled like folder. Then run from_a_folder_of_sm.
